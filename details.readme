OBJECT acessing as an array--->
in object keys are always be STRING if it is not STRING then itb is converted into STRING.

eg. const obj = {
    name: "Aayush",
    location: "Bangalore",
    key : value,
};

console.log(obj.name);
console.log(obj["name"]); //we are acessing it as an array.

console.log(obj.location); //inorder to get that value
console.log(obj["location]);

OUTPUT--> "Aayush"
          "Aayush"

          "Bangalore"
          "Bangalore"


REASON to use array is that whta if we dont know what is key what if key is stored in a variable what if key given by user what if key is taken dynimically?
in that case we use obj acessing with array.🙂
i.e var key = "name"
    var k = prompt("Which data you want?");
 
 then we write by using array;

 console.log(obj[key]); --- in order to get value of key
 console.log(obj[k]);

❤️🙂 if we use anything without cot ''/ "" then JavaScript will treate it as a VARIABLE i.e ()
